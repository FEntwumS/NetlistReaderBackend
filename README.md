# FEntwumS Backend

This repository contains the logic of the FEntwumS-Backend, which is to be used in conjunction with the FEntwumS-Plugin
in OneWare Studio. If you want to view your HDL-Code, please download OneWare Studio and install our upcoming plugin.
Specifically, the software can parse a subset of JSON-Netlists generated by yosys. These netlists can then be laid out
using the Eclipse Layout Kernel and may be interactively viewed using an appropriate frontend.
